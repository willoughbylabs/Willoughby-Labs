    About Me

    My name is Andrew but my friends call me Willoughby. Welcome to my workshop! 

    Raised in an Air Force family, Chicago is my 10th place to call home. My passion for learning is driven by the belief that anything is possible with practice. I aspire to inspire. My interests are expansive: from architecture, politics, and astronomy to video games, photography, music, and cycling, my fascination has no bounds.  

    My motto:

    Ask questions
    Navigate challenges
    Defy expectations
    Redefine “possible”
    Earn responsibility
    Wield integrity
